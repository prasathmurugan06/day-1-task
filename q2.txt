Objects and properties

The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object
objectName.propertyName

Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive.

var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Swift';
myCar.model = 'Mustang';
myCar.year = 2000;

You can also access properties by using a string value that is stored in a variable:
var propertyName = 'make';
myCar[propertyName] = 'Ford';propertyName = 'model';myCar[propertyName] = 'Mustang';

Creating Objects In JavaScript :
Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal
One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values inside curly braces as shown below
let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};

Create JavaScript Object with Constructor
Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create multiple objects of same flavor as shown below
function Vehicle(name, maker) {
  this.name = name;
  this.maker = maker;
}
let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
console.log(car1.name);    //Output: Fiesta
console.log(car2.name);    //Output: Santa Fe


Using the JavaScript Keyword new
The following example also creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:
Example
var person = new Object();
person.firstName = “Prasath”;
person.lastName = “Murugan”;
person.age = 24;
person.eyeColor = “black”;


Using the Object.create method
Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. This method can be very useful
